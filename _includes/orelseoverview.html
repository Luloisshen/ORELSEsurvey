                <p> The ORELSE survey is a systematic search for large-scale structures around an original sample of 20 galaxy clusters in a redshift range of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 with the field of view of all fields ∼0.25–0.5 deg&sup2;. The ORELSE survey is dedicated to study galaxy evolution across the full range of local and global environments with extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations at z ~ 1. </p>
